# Flowbite-Svelte UI Transformation Team Contract

## Team Composition & Roles

### Core Cluster
- **UX Designer**: User journey, settings UX, theme editing experience
- **UI Designer**: Visual design, component architecture, Flowbite customization
- **Frontend Engineer**: Svelte implementation, store architecture, reactive theming
- **QA Engineer**: Testing strategy, validation, quality assurance

### Operating Model: Cluster Pattern
Based on research-cluster and persona-cluster patterns for coordinated parallel work.

## Phase 1: Planning & Design Foundation (Current)

### Objectives
- [x] Establish JSON-based theming architecture
- [x] Define style guide and component patterns
- [ ] Create theme schema specification
- [ ] Design settings editor interface
- [ ] Map Flowbite components to requirements

### Deliverables
1. **Theme JSON Schema** (UI + Frontend)
2. **Settings Editor Mockups** (UX + UI)
3. **Component Inventory** (UI + Frontend)
4. **Test Plan** (QA)

## Phase 2: Implementation & Execution

### Sprint 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
**Frontend Lead**
- [ ] Implement theme store with Svelte
- [ ] Set up JSON file watching
- [ ] Create CSS variable generation system
- [ ] Build theme validation layer

**UI Support**
- [ ] Define base theme presets
- [ ] Create component override patterns
- [ ] Establish color palette system

### Sprint 2: Component Integration (Week 2)
**Frontend + UI Collaboration**
- [ ] Integrate Flowbite components
- [ ] Apply theming system to each component
- [ ] Build settings editor UI
- [ ] Implement live preview

**QA Parallel Track**
- [ ] Set up visual regression testing
- [ ] Create theme validation tests
- [ ] Build accessibility testing suite

### Sprint 3: Polish & Optimization (Week 3)
**All Team**
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Bug fixes and refinements

## Collaboration Protocols

### Daily Sync Points
- **Morning**: Quick status check (15 min)
- **Afternoon**: Design-Dev alignment (as needed)

### Handoff Points
1. **Design → Dev**: Figma specs with tokens
2. **Dev → QA**: Feature branches with test notes
3. **QA → Team**: Bug reports in standardized format

### Communication Channels
- **Primary**: Team Slack channel
- **Design**: Figma comments
- **Code**: PR reviews
- **Issues**: GitHub issues with labels

## Quality Standards

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Feature implemented per spec
- [ ] Theme variations tested
- [ ] Accessibility validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved

### Performance Targets
- Theme switch: < 100ms
- Initial load: < 2s
- Settings save: < 500ms
- Live preview update: < 50ms

### Accessibility Requirements
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation complete
- Screen reader tested
- High contrast mode supported

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **Flowbite customization limitations**
   - Mitigation: Early spike to test boundaries
   
2. **Performance with complex themes**
   - Mitigation: Implement debouncing and optimization

3. **JSON validation complexity**
   - Mitigation: Use JSON Schema with clear errors

4. **Browser compatibility issues**
   - Mitigation: Progressive enhancement approach

## Success Criteria

### Functional
- ✅ VSCode-style JSON configuration working
- ✅ Real-time theme updates
- ✅ Component-level customization
- ✅ Global theme presets

### Non-Functional
- ✅ Performance targets met
- ✅ Accessibility standards achieved
- ✅ Developer experience smooth
- ✅ User satisfaction > 4.5/5

## Team Agreements

1. **Code Style**: Follow existing project conventions
2. **Git Flow**: Feature branches → PR → Review → Merge
3. **Testing**: Write tests alongside features
4. **Documentation**: Update as you go
5. **Communication**: Over-communicate in async work

## Review Checkpoints

- [ ] **Week 1 Review**: Infrastructure complete
- [ ] **Week 2 Review**: Components integrated
- [ ] **Week 3 Review**: Ready for release

## Escalation Path
1. Technical blockers → Frontend lead
2. Design questions → UI lead
3. Requirements clarity → UX lead
4. Quality concerns → QA lead
5. Timeline risks → Team sync
