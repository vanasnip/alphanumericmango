# VAL-001: A/B Testing Framework
## Voice vs Traditional Terminal Workflows Comparative Study

*Version: 1.0*  
*Study Type: Within-subjects randomized controlled trial*  
*Participants: 10-15 power users*  
*Duration: 2-3 hours per participant*

---

## Executive Summary

This A/B testing framework provides a rigorous methodology for comparing voice-controlled terminal workflows against traditional keyboard-based workflows. The study uses a within-subjects design where each participant completes identical tasks using both methods, allowing direct performance comparison.

### Key Objectives
1. **Measure productivity delta** between voice and traditional methods
2. **Identify task categories** where voice excels or fails  
3. **Quantify cognitive load differences** between approaches
4. **Assess error rates and recovery patterns**
5. **Determine learning curve characteristics**

## Analysis Plan

### Primary Analyses

#### 1. Productivity Comparison
```python
# Paired t-test for completion times
from scipy import stats

voice_times = [participant_times_voice]
traditional_times = [participant_times_traditional]

t_statistic, p_value = stats.ttest_rel(voice_times, traditional_times)
effect_size = cohens_d(voice_times, traditional_times)

# Success criterion: Voice within 20% of traditional speed
productivity_ratio = mean(voice_times) / mean(traditional_times)
meets_criterion = productivity_ratio <= 1.20
```

#### 2. Error Rate Analysis  
```python
# Chi-square test for error frequencies
error_contingency = [
    [voice_errors, voice_successes],
    [traditional_errors, traditional_successes]
]
chi2, p_value, dof, expected = stats.chi2_contingency(error_contingency)

# Error recovery time comparison
recovery_times_voice = [error_recovery_times_voice]
recovery_times_traditional = [error_recovery_times_traditional]
```

#### 3. Cognitive Load Assessment
```python
# MANOVA for NASA-TLX dimensions
from statsmodels.multivariate.manova import MANOVA

tlx_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'method': methods,
    'mental': mental_scores,
    'physical': physical_scores,
    'temporal': temporal_scores,
    'performance': performance_scores,
    'effort': effort_scores,
    'frustration': frustration_scores
})

manova = MANOVA.from_formula(
    'mental + physical + temporal + performance + effort + frustration ~ method',
    data=tlx_data
)
```

### Secondary Analyses

#### Learning Curve Modeling
```python
# Exponential learning curve fitting
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit

def learning_curve(trial, a, b, c):
    return a * np.exp(-b * trial) + c

trials = range(1, num_trials + 1)
popt, pcov = curve_fit(learning_curve, trials, completion_times)
```

#### Task-Method Interaction
```python
# 2x3 Repeated Measures ANOVA
# Factor 1: Method (Voice, Traditional)
# Factor 2: Task (Setup, Debug, Deploy)

from statsmodels.stats.anova import AnovaRM

anova = AnovaRM(
    data=performance_data,
    depvar='completion_time',
    subject='participant',
    within=['method', 'task']
).fit()
```
