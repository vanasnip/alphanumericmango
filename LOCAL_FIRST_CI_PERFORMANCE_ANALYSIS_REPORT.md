- Pre-push CI validation framework is well-structured but may exceed target times
- Act workflow execution shows good optimization for local development
- Cache system is properly configured but underutilized (0% cache usage)
- System resources are adequate with 12 CPU cores and 32GB RAM

## System Architecture Analysis

### 1. Infrastructure Specifications

```

#### Layer 2: Act Runner (Local CI Simulation)
```bash
Workflow Listing:   0.367s
Docker Integration: Ubuntu-latest containers
Cache Strategy:     Local .cache and .act-cache directories
```

#### Layer 3: GitHub Actions (Remote CI)
```bash
