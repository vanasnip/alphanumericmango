Absolutely, let’s walk through it step by step. So first off, there’s a consensus that we need to add a few critical safety and reliability features, like an escape key interruption and voice activity detection. We’ll make sure those go into the voice system requirements. Then we’ll add a section on security requirements to cover tunnel security, authentication, and data protection. And we’ll also add some performance benchmarks—like making sure the response time for voice activation is under 200 milliseconds.

And finally, we’ll pivot from the idea of building a full custom terminal to a terminal enhancement overlay, which will definitely save a ton of time and complexity. And we’ll adjust the MVP and future phases accordingly so we have a more realistic roadmap.

So yep, we’ll get all those updates into the spec and make sure it’s all covered.

“Okay, that sounds good. All of it I agree with. The idea of an overlay makes sense. I did have concerns that going custom is kind of a lot to bite off, so going overlay is more appealing. And I think that it's worth exploring and doing some research around any open source terminals projects that might actually dovetail really nicely in the sense that we can fork a project and then expand and add the features that we need because it's far enough. I've been using WEZ Terminal. It's W-E-Z Term, W-E-Z-T-E-R-M, and it's got a node project. It looks open source to me. I might be wrong, but we can potentially fork that project because it's got a lot of custom things that you can add to it. It might not necessarily be viable, which is fine. It's more that the features and the things we want to add on top could easily be augmented on top of something that's already pre-built as a terminal and perhaps is open source.”

Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, and it's a smart approach. Going with an overlay on top of something like WezTerm, especially if it’s open source and extensible, can save a ton of effort. That way, you can layer in your own features without having to reinvent the wheel. We can definitely explore that and look into whether forking WezTerm or a similar project is a good fit for what you want to do. So that’s a great idea, and we can definitely add that into the plan as well.

“In addition to this, I think streamlining the MVP should be something we should consider quite critically in terms of everything that we're going through, what should sit as part of the MVP, what are the implications of that, and fully consider and plan around the MVP such that it's perhaps even architected in such a way that we're able to then move forward, because the main point of the MVP is to establish the core functionality of what the bread and butter of the application will be, such that we can qualify the technology choices, the implementation choices, so in that sense it has to be minimal and kind of get to a place where we can definitely decide that, okay, this is the technology for us simply because it works in this fashion, or it's definitely not the technology for us because of such and such a reason. So I think some upfront speculation about those things and some planning is critical, and also some considerations for what are the stop points for when we decide whether where we qualify the technology as being viable or not viable.”

Absolutely, and that’s a really key point. The MVP really is all about establishing that core functionality and making sure that the tech stack and the design choices are validated early on. So we’ll definitely streamline it and focus on a minimal but fully functional core. That way, we can validate if the terminal overlay approach works, if the voice integration is smooth, and if the overall architecture is on point before we invest more time. And we’ll set clear criteria so that once the MVP is done, we know if we’re on the right track or if we need to pivot. So yeah, we’ll definitely bake that into the planning.
