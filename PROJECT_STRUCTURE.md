# Project X - Development Structure

## Current Setup

### Active Development Areas

1. **`project-x-prototype/`** - React UI Prototype (ACTIVE)
   - Your current focus area
   - Voice input interface
   - UI components and interactions
   - Can continue development independently

2. **`electron-shell/`** - Desktop Application Shell (READY TO DEVELOP)
   - Electron main process setup
   - Will eventually wrap the React prototype
   - Can be developed in parallel

3. **`modules/`** - Standalone Modules (READY TO DEVELOP)
   - `tmux-controller/` - Terminal control layer
   - `voice-engine/` - Voice processing pipeline
   - Can be developed and tested independently

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Parallel Development (Current)
- Continue React prototype in `project-x-prototype/`
- Develop Electron shell separately
- Build and test modules independently

### Phase 2: Integration (Week 3-4)
```
electron-shell/
├── main/
│   ├── index.ts         (imports modules)
│   ├── ipc-handlers.ts  (communication)
│   └── window.ts        (loads React app)
├── renderer/            (your React prototype)
└── modules/            (tmux, voice, etc.)
```

### Phase 3: Unified Application
- React prototype becomes the renderer process
- Electron provides desktop capabilities
- Modules provide core functionality

## Next Steps Without Conflicts

1. **Install dependencies for Electron shell**:
   ```bash
   cd electron-shell
   npm install
   ```

2. **Test tmux controller independently**:
   ```bash
   cd modules/tmux-controller
   npx ts-node index.ts
   ```

3. **Continue React prototype development**:
   ```bash
   cd project-x-prototype
   npm run dev
   ```

## Integration Points (Future)

- IPC bridge between Electron main and React renderer
- Voice engine hooks into React UI
- tmux output displays in React terminal component
- Settings and preferences shared via IPC

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **No Conflicts**: Each part can be developed independently
2. **Parallel Work**: Multiple developers can work simultaneously
3. **Easy Testing**: Each module can be tested in isolation
4. **Clean Integration**: Clear boundaries between components
5. **Flexibility**: Can swap implementations if needed
