```

#### Emergency Rollback (5-15 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Database state rollback (if needed)
python scripts/rollback_database.py --to-timestamp="<pre-deployment>"

# 2. Clear potentially poisoned caches
redis-cli FLUSHDB
kubectl delete configmap voice-engine-cache

# 3. Restart all related services
kubectl rollout restart deployment/voice-engine
kubectl rollout restart deployment/voice-gateway
```

#### Full System Restore (15-30 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Restore from backup if system compromise suspected
kubectl apply -f backups/voice-engine-<timestamp>.yaml

# 2. Full security scan of restored system
nmap -sS -O voice-engine-internal
python security_scanner.py --target=voice-engine --full-scan

# 3. Manual verification of all security controls
pytest test/security/ --verbose --tb=short
```

### Post-Rollback Actions
