# Context Checkpoint - 2025-01-15 22:50

## Current State: Lobby Mode Active 🏛️

### Agent/Mode
- **Active Persona**: Frontend Cluster (fe-cluster)
- **Location**: Voice Terminal component library development
- **Working Directory**: `/Users/ivan/DEV_/alphanumericmango`

### Entry Reason
Entered lobby to discuss UI/UX improvements and build component library with Paper theme

---

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. UI/UX Documentation Complete
- Created comprehensive `voice-terminal-ui-improvements.md`
- Documented Paper theme (neumorphic design system)
- Captured all design inspirations:
  - Font on paper aesthetic
  - Chat bubble differentiation
  - Wide view of projects with color coding
  - Hexagonal voice indicator
- Created detailed specifications for 8 improvements

### 2. Component Library Infrastructure
- Set up complete development environment at `voice-terminal-components/`
- Vite + TypeScript + Vitest + Storybook
- Design token system with Paper theme
- CSS modules for scoped styling

### 3. Components Built (6 of 8 Complete)

#### Phase 1 (Foundation) ✅
- **Paper**: Neumorphic container with elevation variants
- **Typography**: Complete text system with all variants
- **Button**: Interactive with loading/disabled states

#### Phase 2 (Features) ✅
- **MessageBubble**: Chat interface with user/agent differentiation
- **HexagonGrid**: Dynamic voice visualization (1→7→19→37 hexagons)
- **TabBar**: Seamless navigation with project colors

#### Phase 3 (Remaining)
- TextField (pending)
- ProjectCard (pending)

### 4. Parallel Development Success
- Used multiple FE clusters simultaneously
- Built 3 components in parallel per phase
- All components have >80% test coverage
- Full TypeScript support
- Comprehensive Storybook documentation

## Current Active Work

### Storybook Running
- **URL**: http://localhost:6007
- **Status**: Running successfully
- **Background Processes**:
  - PID b575a8: npm run storybook (port 6006)
  - PID 3a392e: npm run storybook (port 6006)
  - PID f0cecb: npx storybook dev -p 6007 (active)

### Recent Fix
- Resolved Paper component export issue
- Both named and default imports now work

## Pending Feedback

### MessageBubble Component - Awaiting User Feedback
**User wants to review the chat bubble implementation**

Current MessageBubble features implemented:
- **Shape differentiation**: 
  - User messages: Pill shape (50% border radius)
  - Agent messages: Rounded rectangle (8-12px radius)
- **Alignment**: 
  - User: right-aligned
  - Agent: left-aligned
- **Avatars**: Support for images and initials
- **Timestamps**: Above bubbles
- **Model badges**: For AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini)
- **Theme integration**: Light/dark modes with Paper aesthetic

**Key design decisions to review:**
1. Pill vs rectangle shape differentiation
2. Avatar placement and sizing
3. Timestamp positioning
4. Model badge implementation
5. Color scheme in both themes
6. Animation and transitions
7. Overall integration with Paper theme

---

## Key Design Decisions Made

### Paper Theme System
- Replacing Ocean theme entirely
- Light mode: "Paper" (#EFF2F9 base)
- Dark mode: "Midnight Paper" (gray-based, not black)
- Neumorphic shadows instead of borders
- 8px grid system for spacing

### Voice Indicator
- Hexagonal propagation pattern
- Pure shadow-based (no colors)
- Amplitude drives expansion
- Optional photon pulse effect (experimental)

### Project Management
- 9-color palette for project identification
- Subtle usage (thin line, typing dots)
- Color as orientation, not decoration

---

## Repository Status
- **Branch**: main
- **Latest Commit**: bce77a8 (Paper export fix)
- **Remote**: https://github.com/vanasnip/alphanumericmango.git
- **All changes pushed**: ✅

---

## Next Steps After Feedback

1. **Review MessageBubble in Storybook** - Get user feedback on current implementation
2. **Adjust based on feedback** - Make any necessary changes to chat bubbles
3. **Complete Phase 3** - Build TextField and ProjectCard components
4. **Integration planning** - Start integrating components into main Voice Terminal app
5. **Theme migration** - Replace Ocean theme with Paper theme in main app
