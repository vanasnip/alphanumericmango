# Discovery → UX Research Interface

> **Version**: 1.0  
> **From Team**: Discovery  
> **To Team**: UX Research  
> **Project**: Voice-Driven Settings Configuration System  
> **Purpose**: Define handoff protocol and data exchange format  

## Interface Overview

This interface defines how the Discovery team transfers voice pattern findings and initial analysis to the UX Research team for validation and refinement through user testing.

## Data Exchange Format

### 1. Voice Pattern Corpus
**Format**: Structured JSON + Markdown documentation  
**Location**: `voice-settings-project/teams/discovery/voice-patterns.json`  

```json
{
  "patterns": [
    {
      "id": "appearance_001",
      "category": "appearance",
      "intent": "change_theme",
      "examples": [
        "Turn on dark mode",
        "Switch to dark theme",
        "Enable dark mode"
      ],
      "parameters": {
        "theme": ["dark", "light", "auto"]
      },
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "needs_validation": true
    }
  ],
  "disambiguation_rules": {
    "ambiguous_commands": [
      {
        "command": "make it bigger",
        "possible_intents": ["font_size", "window_size", "ui_scale"],
        "suggested_clarification": "What would you like to make bigger?"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. Settings Categories Map
**Format**: Hierarchical structure document  
**Location**: `voice-settings-project/teams/discovery/settings-categories.md`  

```yaml
categories:
  appearance:
    settings: [theme, font_size, font_family, contrast]
    voice_priority: high
    common_commands: 15
    
  voice_recognition:
    settings: [language, confidence, timeout, continuous]
    voice_priority: medium
    common_commands: 8
```

### 3. Research Questions
**Format**: Priority-ranked research needs  
**Location**: `voice-settings-project/teams/discovery/research-questions.md`  

```markdown
## Critical Questions for UX Research

### High Priority
1. Do users prefer "turn on" vs "enable" vs "activate"?
2. How do users naturally express relative changes (bigger/smaller)?
3. What disambiguation method feels most natural?

### Medium Priority
4. Which settings do users actually want to control via voice?
5. How much confirmation is needed for different settings?
```

## Handoff Protocol

### Week 1 Handoff (2025-09-20)
**Discovery provides:**
- Initial 10-15 voice patterns for early validation
- Draft settings categories (may be incomplete)
- Known ambiguity points

**UX Research begins:**
- Pilot testing with initial patterns
- Recruitment continues
- Test environment setup

### Week 2 Complete Handoff (2025-09-23)
**Discovery delivers:**
- Complete 20+ voice patterns
- Final 8 category definitions
- Full disambiguation rules
- JSON schema proposal

**UX Research executes:**
- Full user testing sessions
- Pattern validation
- Guidelines development

## Success Criteria

### From Discovery
- ✅ 20+ documented voice patterns
- ✅ 8 settings categories defined
- ✅ Disambiguation scenarios identified
- ✅ Initial JSON schema proposed

### For UX Research
- ✅ Validate >90% pattern success rate
- ✅ Test with 12+ diverse users
- ✅ Identify pattern improvements
- ✅ Create priority matrix

## Communication Protocol

### Regular Sync Points
- **Daily**: Async updates via progress trackers
- **Week 1 End**: Pattern validation checkpoint
- **Week 2 Mid**: Preliminary findings share
- **Week 2 End**: Final handoff session

### Escalation Path
1. Team-level resolution attempted first
2. Teams Agent facilitates if needed
3. Stakeholder involvement if critical

## Quality Gates

### Discovery Completion Criteria
- [ ] All patterns documented with examples
- [ ] Categories logically organized
- [ ] Ambiguities explicitly noted
- [ ] Schema technically feasible

### UX Research Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Patterns sufficient for testing
- [ ] Categories cover user needs
- [ ] Research questions clear
- [ ] Timeline achievable

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Owner | Mitigation |
|------|-------|------------|
| Incomplete patterns | Discovery | Deliver incrementally |
| Testing delays | UX Research | Start with available patterns |
| Scope creep | Both | Stick to 8 categories |
| Communication gaps | Teams Agent | Daily progress review |

## Interface Evolution

This interface may be updated based on:
- Emerging findings during research
- Technical constraints discovered
- User feedback requiring new patterns
- Timeline adjustments
