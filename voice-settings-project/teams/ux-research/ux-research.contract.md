# UX Research Team Contract - Voice Settings Project

> **Version**: 1.0  
> **Team**: ux-research  
> **Project**: Voice-Driven Settings Configuration System  
> **Purpose**: Validate and refine voice interaction patterns through user research  

## Team Mission

The UX Research team validates Discovery findings through rigorous user testing, ensuring voice commands feel natural and intuitive. We transform theoretical patterns into validated, user-tested interaction guidelines that enable successful implementation.

## Core Deliverables

### 1. User Testing Report
**Format**: Comprehensive research findings  
**Due Date**: 2025-09-27  

```yaml
specifications:
  testing_methodology:
    - Participants: 12-15 users minimum
    - User segments: Power users, general users, accessibility users
    - Testing protocol: Think-aloud with Wizard of Oz
    - Success metrics: Command recognition rate >90%
    
  validation_results:
    - Pattern success rates for Discovery's 20+ commands
    - User confusion points and failures
    - Natural language variations discovered
    - Recommended pattern refinements
    
  insights:
    - Most intuitive command structures
    - Common mental models for settings
    - Disambiguation preference testing results
    - Accessibility-specific findings
```

### 2. Voice Interaction Guidelines
**Format**: Design principles and patterns  
**Due Date**: 2025-09-30  

```yaml
must_include:
  command_principles:
    - Natural language structure rules
    - Consistency patterns across settings
    - Error recovery strategies
    - Confirmation requirements
    
  feedback_design:
    - Audio feedback patterns
    - Visual confirmation indicators
    - Processing state communication
    - Success/failure messaging
    
  accessibility_guidelines:
    - Extended timeout accommodations
    - Alternative input methods
    - Screen reader compatibility
    - Cognitive load considerations
```

### 3. Settings Priority Matrix
**Format**: Categorized settings by voice suitability  
**Due Date**: 2025-09-30  

```yaml
categories:
  voice_first:
    - Settings users prefer to control via voice
    - Frequency: Daily/multiple times per session
    - Examples: Theme switching, font size, volume
    
  voice_optional:
    - Settings that work well with voice or UI
    - Frequency: Weekly/occasional
    - Examples: Language, notifications, display options
    
  visual_first:
    - Settings better suited for visual interface
    - Complexity: Multi-step or precise values
    - Examples: API keys, detailed permissions, color picking
```

## Input Requirements

### From Discovery Team
- 20+ voice command patterns to validate
- 8 settings categories to test
- Initial disambiguation rules
- JSON schema structure

### From Project Context
- Existing voice terminal implementation
- Current settings panel (4 categories)
- Performance requirements (<100ms response)
- Accessibility standards

## Output Interfaces

### To Frontend Team
- Validated UI copy for voice feedback
- Visual indicator specifications
- Settings panel organization by priority
- Accessibility requirements

### To Backend Team
- Confirmed JSON schema structure
- Validation rules for voice inputs
- Settings that require persistence
- Hot-reload trigger points

### To Integration Team
- Natural language processing requirements
- Command parsing patterns
- Disambiguation logic validated
- Error handling strategies

## Quality Standards

### Research Rigor
- Statistical significance in findings (p<0.05)
- Diverse participant pool (30% accessibility users)
- Multiple testing methods (triangulation)
- Recorded sessions for review

### Validation Metrics
- Command success rate: >90%
- User satisfaction: >4.2/5
- Task completion time: <5 seconds
- Error recovery success: >85%

## Working Principles

### 1. User-Centered Validation
Every pattern must be tested with real users, not assumed.

### 2. Accessibility-First Design
Voice interaction must work for users with diverse abilities.

### 3. Natural Language Priority
Support how people actually speak, not forcing syntax.

### 4. Evidence-Based Refinement
All recommendations backed by user testing data.

## Research Methods

### Primary Methods
1. **Think-Aloud Protocol** - Understanding mental models
2. **Wizard of Oz Testing** - Simulating voice interactions
3. **A/B Testing** - Comparing disambiguation strategies
4. **Task-Based Testing** - Real scenario validation

### Data Collection
- Screen and audio recording
- Success/failure rates
- Time to completion
- User satisfaction scores
- Qualitative feedback

## Validation Gates

### Week 2 Checkpoint (2025-09-24)
- [ ] 50% of user testing complete
- [ ] Initial pattern validation results
- [ ] Emerging insights documented

### Week 3 Completion (2025-09-30)
- [ ] All testing complete (12+ participants)
- [ ] Guidelines finalized
- [ ] Priority matrix delivered
- [ ] Handoff to development teams

## Success Metrics

### Research Quality
