- What features absolutely require terminal-specific integration?
- How do we handle terminal diversity (iTerm, Terminal.app, Alacritty, etc.)?
- Can the agent layer truly remain unaware of terminal implementation?

**5. Access Point Requirements**
- **Essential Access**: What do we absolutely need to capture/inject?
- **Nice-to-Have Access**: What would enhance UX but isn't critical?
- **Unnecessary Control**: What terminal features can we completely ignore?
- **Risk of Over-Engineering**: Where might we be solving non-problems?
