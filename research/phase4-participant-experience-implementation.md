- Context switching efficiency: voice vs keyboard/mouse
- Complex workflow automation through natural language
- Error recovery and correction patterns

## For Experienced Developers
- 3-hour hands-on session with cutting-edge voice terminal interface
- Test unreleased voice workflow technologies
- Direct influence on tool design and feature prioritization
- $100 compensation + early access to tools

## Technical Requirements
- 5+ years terminal experience
- Daily Git/CLI usage
- macOS/Linux development environment
- Quiet testing environment available

## Architecture Overview
- Real-time speech recognition with developer-optimized language models
- Context-aware command interpretation
- Integration with existing terminal multiplexers
- Minimal latency voice-to-command pipeline

## What You'll Test
1. **Complex Command Chains**: "git checkout -b feature/voice-integration and git push -u origin feature/voice-integration"
2. **Context-Aware Navigation**: "open the main service file" → automatically resolves to correct path
3. **Error Recovery**: Natural language error correction and command modification
4. **Workflow Integration**: Seamless switching between voice and traditional input

## Developer Impact
Your feedback directly influences:
- Command syntax optimization
- Error handling improvements
- Integration with popular dev tools

# Help fellow developers: Voice terminal workflow research (actually legit)

## TL;DR
Researchers are testing if voice commands can actually make terminal work faster. Need experienced devs to try it out. 3-hour session gets you $100, or 20-min survey for early access to findings.

## Why This Matters
We've all seen the "voice coding" demos that look cool but suck in practice. This research is different - they're actually testing real developer workflows with people who know what they're doing.

## What They're Testing
- Can voice actually beat keyboard for complex commands?
- Does it work when your office is noisy?
- What about when you're context-switching between 15 different projects?
- How fast can you recover when the voice recognition screws up?

## Real Talk
- They're paying $100 for 3 hours of your time
- You get to play with unreleased tech
- Your feedback actually influences what gets built
- 20-minute survey option if you can't do the full session

## Requirements
- Actually use terminal daily (they'll verify)
- 5+ years dev experience
- Willing to give honest feedback (even if it's "this sucks")

## My Experience
[If posting as community member] I did the pilot - it's actually pretty well organized and the tech is more polished than I expected. Worth the time if you're curious about where voice interfaces are heading.
