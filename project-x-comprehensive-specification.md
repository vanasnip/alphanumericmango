## 4. MVP Planning & Architecture Decisions

### 4.1 Terminal Implementation Research Questions

#### Fundamental Architecture Questions

**1. Build vs. Fork vs. Overlay Decision**

- **Session Layer**: Is tmux universal enough to be our standardization point?
- **Agent Layer**: Can agents remain completely terminal-agnostic?

**3. tmux as Abstraction Layer**
- Does tmux provide sufficient programmatic access for our needs?
- Can tmux handle all required I/O capture and injection?
- Is tmux adoption widespread enough to require as dependency?
- What's the fallback strategy for non-tmux environments?

**4. Terminal Agnosticism Validation**
- Can we achieve 100% terminal independence via tmux layer?
- What features absolutely require terminal-specific integration?
- How do we handle terminal diversity (iTerm, Terminal.app, Alacritty, etc.)?
- Can the agent layer truly remain unaware of terminal implementation?

**5. Access Point Requirements**
- **Essential Access**: What do we absolutely need to capture/inject?
- **Nice-to-Have Access**: What would enhance UX but isn't critical?
- **Unnecessary Control**: What terminal features can we completely ignore?
- **Risk of Over-Engineering**: Where might we be solving non-problems?
