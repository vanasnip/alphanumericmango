# Discovery Team Contract - Voice Settings Project

> **Version**: 1.0  
> **Team**: discovery  
> **Project**: Voice-Driven Settings Configuration System  
> **Purpose**: Define interfaces, deliverables, and quality standards for voice settings discovery  

## Team Mission

The Discovery team for this project will explore and document how users naturally express settings preferences through voice, understand the application's current structure, and define requirements for a voice-driven settings configuration system with JSON persistence.

## Core Deliverables

### 1. Voice Interaction Pattern Analysis
**Format**: Structured markdown with examples  
**Due Date**: 2025-09-23  

```yaml
specifications:
  voice_patterns:
    - Common command structures
    - Natural language variations
    - Settings vocabulary mapping
    - Disambiguation rules
    
  user_mental_models:
    - How users think about settings
    - Expected voice commands
    - Settings categorization preferences
    - Navigation expectations
    
  command_grammar:
    - Intent structures
    - Parameter extraction patterns
    - Confirmation patterns
    - Error recovery phrases
```

### 2. Settings Architecture Requirements
**Format**: Technical specification document  
**Due Date**: 2025-09-30  

```yaml
must_include:
  settings_categories:
    - Primary setting groups
    - Hierarchical organization
    - Voice navigation paths
    - Cross-references
    
  json_schema_requirements:
    - Data structure design
    - Value type specifications
    - Default values
    - Validation rules
    - Hot-reload triggers
    
  ui_requirements:
    - Settings screen layout
    - Voice feedback indicators
    - Real-time update visualization
    - Accessibility requirements
```

### 3. Voice-to-Settings Mapping Document
**Format**: Structured mapping with examples  
**Due Date**: 2025-09-30  

```yaml
structure:
  intent_mappings:
    - Voice intent → Setting action
    - Parameter extraction rules
    - Value transformation logic
    - Confirmation requirements
    
  edge_cases:
    - Ambiguous commands
    - Multiple interpretations
    - Error scenarios
    - Recovery strategies
    
  examples:
    - "Turn on dark mode" → settings.theme.mode = "dark"
    - "Make text bigger" → settings.display.fontSize += 2
    - "Change language to Spanish" → settings.locale = "es"
```

### 4. Team Recommendations & Interfaces
**Format**: Team composition and handoff plan  
**Due Date**: 2025-09-30  

```yaml
recommendations:
  team_sequence:
    - Phase 1: UX Research activation
    - Phase 2: Backend + Frontend parallel
    - Phase 3: Integration specialist
    - Phase 4: QA validation
    
  interface_definitions:
    - Discovery → UX Research handoff
    - UX → Frontend requirements
    - Backend → Frontend contracts
    - Integration → All teams APIs
```

## Input Requirements

### Application Analysis Needs
- Current settings structure
- Existing UI patterns
- User interaction logs (if available)
- Technical constraints

### Voice Exploration Requirements
- Voice command testing environment
- Sample user scenarios
- Settings modification use cases
- Performance requirements

## Output Interfaces

### To UX Research Team
- Voice pattern corpus
- User vocabulary documentation
- Mental model insights
- Navigation preferences

### To Frontend Team
- Settings UI requirements
- Voice feedback specifications
- Real-time update requirements
- Component state definitions

### To Backend Team
- JSON schema specifications
- Persistence requirements
- Hot-reload triggers
- Validation rules

### To Integration Team
- Voice processing requirements
- Intent mapping logic
- Command disambiguation rules
- API specifications

## Quality Standards

### Research Depth
- Minimum 20 voice command patterns documented
- 5-8 settings categories identified
- Complete intent mapping for core settings
- Edge case coverage >80%

### Documentation Quality
- Clear command examples
- Unambiguous specifications
- Testable requirements
- Implementation-ready detail

## Working Principles

### 1. Voice-First Design
Every setting must be easily accessible via natural voice commands.

### 2. Real-Time Response
Settings changes must take effect immediately without restart.

### 3. Natural Language Focus
Support how users naturally speak, not forcing specific syntax.

### 4. Accessibility Priority
Voice and visual interfaces must be equally accessible.

## Validation Gates

### Week 1 Checkpoint
- [ ] Voice patterns documented (>10)
- [ ] Settings categories identified
- [ ] Initial schema structure proposed

### Week 2 Completion
- [ ] All deliverables complete
- [ ] Team recommendations finalized
- [ ] Handoff documentation ready
- [ ] Stakeholder approval obtained

## Success Metrics

### Discovery Quality
- Voice command coverage >95%
- Settings mapping completeness 100%
- Edge case identification >80%
- Clear disambiguation rules

### Process Quality
- On-time milestone delivery
- Clear team handoffs
- Minimal clarification requests

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Voice command ambiguity | Create comprehensive disambiguation rules |
| Complex settings hierarchy | Propose flattened structure where possible |
| JSON schema complexity | Iterative refinement with Backend team |
| Natural language variance | Build synonym mapping database |

## Handoff Protocol

### To UX Research (Week 1)
1. Voice pattern analysis document
2. Initial findings briefing
3. Collaboration on user testing

### To Development Teams (Week 2)
1. Complete requirements package
2. Technical specification review
3. Q&A session
4. Ongoing support commitment
