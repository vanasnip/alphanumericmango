# Voice Control Architecture & Permissions Model

## Overview

This document outlines the voice control architecture for the AI Voice Terminal, implementing an MCP-inspired paradigm where the Large Language Model (LLM) acts as an intermediary between voice commands and application functionality through exposed text-based tools and settings.

## Core Concept: Voice-Driven Tool Interface

### The MCP-Style Paradigm

Similar to Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, the application exposes a set of "tools" that the LLM can trigger through text commands. This creates a clean separation between:

1. **Voice Input** → Natural language from user
2. **LLM Processing** → Understanding intent and mapping to tools
3. **Tool Execution** → Text commands sent to application
4. **UI Response** → Application executes the change

### Key Principles

- **Text-Based Control**: All UI changes are triggered via text commands the LLM can send
- **Tool Registry**: Defined set of actions available to the assistant
- **Conversational Interface**: Natural dialogue instead of menu navigation
- **Feedback Loop**: Assistant confirms actions and results

## Permissions Model

### Progressive Trust System

The application implements a progressive permissions model that evolves from explicit confirmation to trusted automation:

#### Level 1: Explicit Confirmation (Default)
```
User: "Change the layout to vertical split"
AI: "I'll change the layout to vertical split. Say 'engage' to confirm."
User: "Engage"
→ Action executes
```

#### Level 2: Trust Building
After multiple successful executions of the same command:
```
AI: "I've noticed you've run this command 5 times. Would you like me to execute 'vertical split' automatically in the future?"
User: "Yes"
→ Command added to trusted list
```

#### Level 3: Trusted Automation
```
User: "Vertical split"
AI: "Changing to vertical split layout"
→ Immediate execution without confirmation
```

### Permission Configuration

```typescript
interface PermissionConfig {
  command: string;
  trustLevel: 'confirm' | 'notify' | 'auto';
  executionCount: number;
  trustThreshold: number; // After X executions, suggest auto-trust
  riskLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
}
```

### Permission Categories

- **Low Risk** (Layout, Theme): Can be auto-trusted quickly
- **Medium Risk** (Clear data, Reset settings): Requires more confirmations
- **High Risk** (System commands): Always require confirmation

## Available Tools & Actions

### Layout Control

```typescript
// Exposed layout tools
interface LayoutTools {
  'layout.split.vertical': () => void;
  'layout.split.horizontal': () => void;
  'layout.swap': () => void;
  'layout.conversation.position': (position: 'left' | 'right' | 'top' | 'bottom') => void;
  'layout.resize': (ratio: number) => void;
  'layout.reset': () => void;
}
```

**Voice Examples:**
- "Split the screen vertically"
- "Move conversation to the left"
- "Make the terminal bigger"
- "Swap panels"

### Theme & Appearance

```typescript
interface ThemeTools {
  'theme.mode': (mode: 'light' | 'dark' | 'auto') => void;
  'theme.gradient.background': (colors: string[]) => void;
  'theme.colors.primary': (color: string) => void;
  'theme.colors.accent': (color: string) => void;
  'theme.font.size': (size: number) => void;
  'theme.font.family': (family: string) => void;
}
```

**Voice Examples:**
- "I'd like a gradient background"
- "Make the text larger"
- "Switch to dark mode"
- "Use a blue and purple gradient"

### Settings Management

```typescript
interface SettingsTools {
  'settings.open': (panel?: string) => void;
  'settings.save': () => void;
  'settings.reset': (category?: string) => void;
  'settings.export': () => void;
  'settings.import': (config: string) => void;
}
```

## Conversational Theme Configuration

### Iterative Design Process

The assistant guides users through theme customization conversationally:

```
User: "I want to change the theme"
AI: "I can help you customize the theme. What would you like to change - colors, background, or fonts?"
User: "I'd like a gradient background"
AI: "Great! What colors would you like for the gradient? For example, 'blue to purple' or 'dark gray to black'?"
User: "Something with blue and green but not too bright"
AI: "How about a subtle gradient from deep ocean blue (#1a3a52) to forest green (#2d5a3d)? I can preview it for you."
User: "That's too dark"
AI: "Let me brighten it up. How about sky blue (#4a90e2) to mint green (#52c7a4)?"
User: "Perfect, apply it"
→ Theme updates
```

### Gradient Configuration Example

```typescript
interface GradientConfig {
  type: 'linear' | 'radial';
  angle?: number;
  colors: Array<{
    color: string;
    position: number; // 0-100
  }>;
}

// LLM sends text command:
"theme.gradient.set linear 45deg #4a90e2 0% #52c7a4 100%"
```

## Implementation Architecture

### 1. Voice Recognition Layer
- Captures user speech
- Converts to text transcript
- Passes to LLM for processing

### 2. LLM Processing Layer
- Interprets natural language
- Maps intent to available tools
- Handles conversational flow
- Generates appropriate responses

### 3. Tool Execution Layer
- Registry of available actions
- Parameter validation
- Permission checking
- Execution and rollback capabilities

### 4. Feedback Layer
- Visual confirmation of changes
- Audio responses via TTS
- Error handling and recovery
- Success/failure indicators

## Configuration Schema

### User Preferences

```yaml
voice_control:
  permissions:
    default_trust_level: "confirm"
    auto_trust_threshold: 5
    high_risk_always_confirm: true
    
  trusted_commands:
    - command: "layout.split.vertical"
      trust_level: "auto"
    - command: "theme.mode"
      trust_level: "notify"
      
  theme:
    allow_voice_customization: true
    preview_before_apply: true
    save_history: true
    
  assistant:
    verbosity: "concise"
    confirmation_style: "brief"
    speak_responses: true
```

## Advanced Features

### Smart Suggestions

The assistant learns patterns and suggests optimizations:

```
AI: "I notice you often switch to vertical split when working on code. Would you like this as your default?"
```

### Context-Aware Commands

Commands adapt based on current state:

```
User: "Make it bigger"
AI: (Knows user is looking at terminal) "Increasing terminal panel size to 65%"
```

### Batch Operations

Execute multiple changes in sequence:

```
User: "Set up my coding environment"
AI: "I'll apply your coding preset: vertical split, dark theme, terminal on left. Engage?"
```

## Security & Safety

### Command Validation

- All commands validated against allowed actions
- Parameters checked for valid ranges
- Dangerous operations require explicit confirmation
- Audit log of all voice-triggered changes

### Rollback Capability

```typescript
interface ActionHistory {
  timestamp: Date;
  command: string;
  previousState: any;
  newState: any;
  canRollback: boolean;
}
```

Voice command: "Undo last change" → Reverts to previous state

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Custom Voice Commands**: Users can define their own command aliases
2. **Macro Recording**: Record sequences of actions as named commands
3. **Profile Management**: Save and switch between different configurations
4. **Collaborative Settings**: Share configurations with other users
5. **AI Learning**: Assistant learns user preferences over time

### Extensibility

The tool registry can be extended with plugins:

```typescript
interface PluginTool {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  execute: (params: any) => Promise<ToolResult>;
  permissions: PermissionConfig;
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Accessibility**: Hands-free control for all users
2. **Efficiency**: Faster than navigating menus
3. **Discoverability**: Assistant can explain available options
4. **Personalization**: Conversational approach to customization
5. **Learning**: Progressive trust reduces friction over time

## Conclusion

This voice control architecture creates a powerful, conversational interface for application control. By treating UI operations as tools that the LLM can access through text commands, we enable natural language control while maintaining security through a progressive permissions model. The system grows more efficient over time as it learns which commands can be trusted, ultimately providing a seamless voice-driven experience.
